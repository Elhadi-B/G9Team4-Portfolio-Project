## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **static website** that showcases all team members through individual profile pages.  
Each member created their own page containing:
- Full name  
- Short professional biography (2–3 sentences)  
- List of technical skills  
- Link to their GitHub profile  

The homepage (`index.html`) lists all team members, with each name linking to their respective profile page.
